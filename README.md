An easier way to use PHPUnit with [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) 3.0.

You don't have to modify CodeIgniter core files at all!

## Requirements

* PHP 5.4.0 or later
* CodeIgniter 3.0.*
* PHPUnit

## Installation

Download latest `ci-phpunit-test`: https://github.com/kenjis/ci-phpunit-test/releases

Unzip and copy `application/tests` folder into your `application` folder in CodeIgniter project. That's it.

If you like Composer:

~~~
$ cd /path/to/codeigniter/
$ composer require kenjis/ci-phpunit-test --dev
~~~

And run `install.php`:

~~~
$ php vendor/kenjis/ci-phpunit-test/install.php
~~~

* Above command always overwrites exisiting files.
* You must run it at CodeIgniter project root folder.

## Upgrading

Download latest `ci-phpunit-test`: https://github.com/kenjis/ci-phpunit-test/releases

Unzip and replace `application/tests/_ci_phpunit_test` folder.

If you like Composer:

~~~
$ cd /path/to/codeigniter/
$ composer update kenjis/ci-phpunit-test
$ php vendor/kenjis/ci-phpunit-test/update.php
~~~

## How to Run Tests

You have to install PHPUnit before running tests.

~~~
$ cd /path/to/codeigniter/
$ cd application/tests/
$ phpunit
PHPUnit 4.6.10 by Sebastian Bergmann and contributors.

Configuration read from /.../codeigniter/application/tests/phpunit.xml

...

Time: 635 ms, Memory: 4.50Mb

OK (3 tests, 4 assertions)

To generate coverage report, Xdebug is needed.

## How to Write Tests

See [docs/HowToWriteTests.md](docs/HowToWriteTests.md)

## Can and Can't

*CI PHPUnit Test* does not want to modify CodeIgniter core files. The more you modify core, the more you get difficulities when you update CodeIgniter.

In fact, it uses a modified class and a few functions. But I try to modify as little as possible.

The functions and the class which are modified:

* function `load_class()`
* function `is_loaded()`
* function `is_cli()`
* function `show_error()`
* function `show_404()`
* class `CI_Loader`

They are in `tests/_ci_phpunit_test/replacing` folder.

### MY_Loader

*CI PHPUnit Test* replaces `CI_Loader` and modifies below methods:

* `CI_Loader::model()`
* `CI_Loader::_ci_load_library()`
* `CI_Loader::_ci_load_stock_library()`

But if you place MY_Loader, your MY_Loader extends the loader of *CI PHPUnit Test*.

If your MY_Loader overrides the above methods, probably *CI PHPUnit Test* does not work correctly.

### `exit()`

*CI PHPUnit Test* does not care functions/classes which `exit()` or `die()` (Except for [show_error() and show_404()](docs/HowToWriteTests.md#show_error-and-show_404)).

So, for example, if you use URL helper `redirect()` in your application code, your testing ends with it.

I recommend you not to use `exit()` or `die()` in your code. And you have to skip `exit()` somehow in CodeIgniter code.

For example, you can modify `redirect()` using `MY_url_helper.php` in your application. I put a sample [MY_url_helper.php](application/helpers/MY_url_helper.php). (I think CodeIgniter code itself should be changed testable.)

See [How to Write Tests](docs/HowToWriteTests.md#redirect) for details.

### Reset CodeIgniter object

CodeIgniter has a function `get_instance()` to get the CodeIgniter object (CodeIgniter instance or CodeIgniter super object).

*CI PHPUnit Test* has a new function `reset_instance()` which reset the current CodeIgniter object. After resetting, you can create a new your Controller instance with new state.

You can see how to use it in [application/tests/_ci_phpunit_test/CIPHPUnitTestCase.php](application/tests/_ci_phpunit_test/CIPHPUnitTestCase.php).
